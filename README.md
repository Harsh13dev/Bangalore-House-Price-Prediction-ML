# Bangalore House Price Prediction

A simple machine learning project to predict house prices in Bangalore based on square footage, BHK, bathrooms, and location.

## How It Works
- A **Linear Regression Model** trained on real estate data to estimate home prices.
- A **Flask API** serves predictions through two endpoints.
- A **User-Friendly Interface** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.
